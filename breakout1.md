Breakout #1: Building the Main Interface Layout

Activity: In your groups, implement the main application layout and basic data integration.

Instructions:

1) Create the main WeatherApp class with the complete layout structure
2) Implement city selection and data loading functionality
3) Connect your processed weather data to the display components
4) Test the interface with your collected weather data
5) Ensure the layout is responsive and handles different window sizes

Expected Output:

- A working main application window with all layout sections
- Functional city selection and data refresh capabilities
- Current weather data displayed in the interface
- Responsive layout that adapts to window resizing

Discussion Points:

- What layout challenges did you encounter with complex interfaces?
- How did you handle connecting database data to UI components?
- What user experience improvements would you make to the basic layout?
